The proposed IoT-enabled water management system integrates real-time monitoring 
of water quality and tank levels to ensure safe and efficient distribution. Using 
electrochemical analysis, the system detects bacterial contamination, such as E. coli, 
through Specially coated electrodes that measure changes in conductivity caused by 
bacteria. Ultrasonic sensors monitor tank levels . Contamination levels and Water 
level are displayed via OLED indicators and through LoRaWAN ,the data is sent to 
the Corporation. providing actionable insights on water treatment or usage.
